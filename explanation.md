1-Minute Explanation Script (MEMORIZE THIS)

“This project focuses on sentiment prediction for Q-Commerce platforms using machine learning.
The dataset used is a consumer survey dataset, which does not contain predefined sentiment labels.
To address this, we manually labeled opinion-based responses into Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories, converting the problem into supervised learning.
Text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction were applied, followed by training a Logistic Regression model with class balancing.
Since survey responses often contain expectations and concerns, we combined machine learning with rule-based post-processing for reliable sentiment prediction.
The final system is demonstrated using a terminal interface and a Streamlit web application.”
